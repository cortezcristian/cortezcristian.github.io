My name is Cristian Cortez a Professional Web Developer & Programmer from Rosario, Argentina.

I have a particular passion for coding and automation which I share with the world around me.

Over the years I have mastered several programming languages and created various courses and participated in conferences related to software design, web coding and new technologies.

After working for more than 8 years as fulltime developer, I discovered a new passion as entrepreneur and consultant.

I love what I do, and that's my spirit!
