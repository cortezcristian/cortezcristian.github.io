Creating an interactive e-learnig platform like CodeSchool, Codeacademy or Treehouse shouldn't be that difficult. 
Nowadays LMS platforms are kind of a big bussines, I believe at some point this will be a very common tool like a blog or a cms and the only differentiator should be the quality of the content you generate. 

Let's go ahead and setup some goals for the platform:

- Should be able to reproduce videos along with presentations
- Should present code excercises and real time auto-correction

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
