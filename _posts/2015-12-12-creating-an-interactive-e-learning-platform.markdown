Creating an interactive e-learnig platform like CodeSchool, Codeacademy or Treehouse shouldn't be that difficult using the MEAN stack. 
Nowadays LMS platforms are kind of a big bussines, I believe at some point this will be a very common tool (like a blog or a cms) and the only differentiator would be the quality of the content you generate. 

Let's go ahead and setup some goals for the platform:

- Should be able to reproduce videos along with presentations
- Should present code excercises and real time auto-correction

And the visual specs:

Let's start a new project using `anyandgo`, that is just another MEAN framework using Express basic and some cool conventions. You'll need to install `nodejs`, `mongodb`, `grunt` and `anyandgo-cli`
{% highlight bash %}
$ [sudo] npm install -g anyandgo-cli
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have it, just create a new project:
{% highlight bash %}
$ anyandgo init lms
{% endhighlight %}

This will create a new folder called `lms`, to finish setup just do:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd lms && npm install && grunt
{% endhighlight %}



Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
